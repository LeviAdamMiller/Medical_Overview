# Hospital Patient Admissions & Medical Overview Dashboard

## Project Objective
To provide a clear and interactive overview of hospital patient admissions and medical conditions using Microsoft Power BI, in order to support healthcare administrators in monitoring patient trends, optimizing resource allocation, and improving care delivery.

## Dataset Used
[healthcare_dataset](https://github.com/LeviAdamMiller/Medical_Overview/blob/main/healthcare_dataset.csv)

## Key Performance Questions
- How many patients were admitted overall, and what percentage were emergency cases?
- What is the average billing amount and average length of stay for patients?
- What are the most common medical conditions among patients?
- How are admissions distributed by type (Elective, Urgent, Emergency)?
- What is the distribution of patients across different insurance providers?
- Which doctors have the highest number of admissions?

## Analysis Process
- Collected and cleaned hospital admission records, billing data, and patient demographic information.
- Aggregated and categorized data by medical condition, admission type, doctor, and insurance provider.
- Built interactive visualizations in Microsoft Power BI including bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards.
- Validated metrics such as total admissions, emergency rate, average billing, and average stay duration.

## Project Insights
- The hospital admitted 40,000 patients, with 33% classified as emergency admissions.
- The average billing amount per patient was $25.54K, and the average length of stay was 16 days.
- Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension were the most common medical conditions.
- Admission types were nearly evenly split among Elective, Urgent, and Emergency categories.
- Patient coverage was evenly distributed across six insurance providers, each covering approximately 20% of the population.
- Dr. Michael Smith recorded the highest number of patient admissions among all doctors.

## Final Conclusion
The dashboard reveals a balanced distribution of admission types and insurer coverage, indicating strong operational consistency. However, the high emergency admission rate (33%) suggests a need for more proactive patient care or improved outpatient services. Itâ€™s recommended to investigate causes of emergency admissions, allocate resources to top medical conditions, and recognize high-performing doctors to support better care outcomes.
